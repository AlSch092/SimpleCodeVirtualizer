# SimpleCodeVirtualizer
A simple compile-time code virtualization class in C++. Still very early in development, soon we'll add in opcode randomization at runtime along with many more opcodes.

More information will be added here as the project is developed further. Anyone is welcome to contribute if you'd like to help implement opcodes.
